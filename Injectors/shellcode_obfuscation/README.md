# Shellcode Obfuscation Techniques

Various techniques and methods for obfuscating shellcode, making it more difficult for detection and analysis by security tools. Change them signatures. 

## Overview

Shellcode obfuscation is the process of modifying shellcode to disguise its true intent or to evade detection by antivirus and other security mechanisms.

This repository provides a collection of obfuscation techniques along with code examples and explanations to demonstrate their implementation and effectiveness.

## Encryption Techniques

- **Caesar cipher**: The Caesar cipher is one of the simplest and earliest known encryption techniques. It operates by shifting each letter in the plaintext by a fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 3 like in my example code.
